# Planning outline

![](/assets/images/plan.svg)

This outline below is a working draft of a comprehensive outline of
topics-of-interest. We use this outline to discuss possible content
and structure for unconferences.

In time we expect a number of position papers/documents (or similar)
to be produced by the community that discuss any of the topics listed
here.
