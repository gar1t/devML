# Unconference format

![](/assets/images/unconference.jpg)

devML uses the
[unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) format for
its half day and full day events. An unconference provides just enough
structure for participants to work collaboratively in the planning and
running of an event.

A devML unconference is characterized by:

- Spirit of openness and flexibility that supports direction
  contributions and all participants

- Egalitarian, democratic process where no individual controls what is
  and what is not presented [^conduct]

[^conduct]:
    All all participants must abide by our [Code of
    Conduct](/conduct/).

- Emphasis on collaborative work-product over unilaterial
  presentations

The last point simply means that we prefer to keep presentations
shorter so that we can spend more time time in break-out sessions
working on specific problems. This is a tendency rather than a rule.

While self-organized, devML unconferences draw from patterns that have
worked well in similar events:

- Provide one or more dedicated periods for [lightning
  talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) in which any
  participant may share briefly on a topic of expertise or interest

- Conduct break-out sessions in small groups, which focus on a
  well-defined problem that is agreed upon by participants

- Present short summaries of break-out group findings

We expect collaboration and ongoing work effort after the unconference. [^license]

[^license]:
    Unless otherwise agreed upon, all work product conducted under the
    auspices of devML is governed by our [contribution
    policy](/contributing/).
