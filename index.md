Bringing together experts in machine learning science and engineering
{: .fs-6 }

<b>devML</b> is a community led effort to strengthen ties between
scientists and engineers doing machine learning. devML supports
practitioners with experience in the field of machine learning. We ask
that participants be able to contribute their knowledge and insights
back to the community. In return, they can expect to learn equally
from their peers.

devML is structured around one or half-day
[unconferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) where
experts present their work (to the extent they can), present problems
to the group, and work on a set of recommended best practices that are
shared within the devML community.

devML also sponsors organizer dinners, in which a member presents a
short topic of interest and participants discuss upcoming
unconferences.
